# HUGTiP HIV-1 Drug Resistance and Lineage Profiling

## Introduction

This Nextflow Pipeline was build following similarly to [QuasiFlow](https://github.com/AlfredUg/QuasiFlow), and utilises [Quasitools HYDRA](https://phac-nml.github.io/quasitools/) for the generation of consensus HIV-1 sequences, and futher analysis of drug resistanc profiles using the [Sierra-local](https://github.com/hivdb/sierra-client/blob/master/python/README.md) through the python package [SierraPy](https://github.com/hivdb/sierra-client/blob/master/python/README.md). Please cite the relevant tools when utilising this workflow.

## Utilisation

This pipeline was built and tested using Nextflow v24.10.1.5930, it has been largely tested using conda as the package manager, but is supported with Docker and Singularity container images built using [Seqera contaier tool](https://seqera.io/containers/).
